# Introduction
I'm **Dael the Verbose**, and I've been kiting hands at Deimos pretty-much every week (often multiple times a week) for more than a year now, and I'm by no means they best hand-kiter but I get people asking me questions about what tips I have or what they could do with knowing when getting into hand-kiting themselves.  
This guide is basically just me trying to collect and note down all my thoughts on the topic, as I'm sure I've always forgotten some things each time someone has asked me.  X)

I'll assume that the reader has knowledge of the Deimos raid encounter in general (e.g. has played as a DPS or healer there before) but no knowledge whatsoever about hand-kiting specifically.

Whenever I can, I'll try to explain *why* I suggest things - rather than just saying 'just build it like this and do these steps in this order' but of course if I've not explained something well, or if you have any questions or thoughts to improve this just hit me up.

# Your Role & Priorities
As a hand-kiter, your role is to keep the very high damage 'hands' off the rest of your team, and away from Deimos during the fight.
Your priorities are in the folowing order:

1. Don't Die
2. Spawn hands away from the main group
3. Position the hands so they won't reach Deimos
4. Pick up [tears][mechanic: tear]
5. Position the hands so they won't reach your team
6. Heal/support your team
7. Damage Deimos/Prides

Points *1* and *2* are the most important by far, and are what you should devote almost all your concentration on (as you get more experienced, you can pay attenton to more stuff further down the list).  
Keeping the hands away from Deimos and your team usually naturally occurs simply by virtue of being the furthest away from the boss throughout the fight, so you don't often have to pay much mind to that.  
Picking up [tears][mechanic: tear] is important, but you'll generally only want to grab them when they're close to you, and when you haven't got hands spawning under you at the time - so you'll often find most [tears][mechanic: tear] are too far away to grab, or are simply picked up by your teammates before you can get to them.

Finally, healing/supporting your team is nice but to be honest I'm going to say not to worry about it at all for the moment.  
Kiting hands is very straightforward once you get used to it, but taking heavy damage can invoke a sort of panic-y feeling at first, and you do want to be paying attention to things like counting the hands as they spawn under you, or noticing when Deimos starts his [Mind Crush][mechanic: mind crush] wind up.  
Trying to do stuff like looking for low-health teammates, maneuvering your heals to them, repositioning yourself so you can reach them, etc. all takes some mental overhead and it becomes *so* easy to get overwhelmed or simply lose track of something you'd normally never have made a mistake over.  
Once you get more experienced, you'll find it much easier to stay calm and keep track of everything while also keeping an eye on your team, and then you'll be able to assess whether you can throw some heals, boons or whatever their way and still stay on top of your core duties.

*FYI: I've never had anyone complain that I didn't help keep people alive, and I know lots of people have died when I probably could have saved them if I was paying more attention or had better reflexes. My point is just that you'll be expected to manage the hands - not to save people, so don't worry if the main group is struggling and you're doing fine. That's just how things play out quite often - the core group can adjust their tactics or comp or whatever, and you just worry about dealing with the hands for them. If you have the extra mental overhead and can afford to help (e.g. have excess energy/cooldowns/whatever), then by all means help them - but it's just a nice bonus - not something to feel bad about if you can't manage it.*

As for damaging Deimos, I probably don't need to say this but it's more of a meme than an actual thing for you to worry about.  
You'll be on full healer gear, so even if you tried to hit him throughout the whole fight, you wouldn't do any meaningful amount of damage anyway.  
The only potentially useful things you could do is assist your team in CC'ing Saul or slowing down the movement of Prides. (e.g. a Scrapper hand-kiter might have [Mortar Kit][skill: mortar kit] and have a quiet moment to throw out an [Endothermic Shell][skill: endothermic shell] to apply Chill to Saul or a Pride from miles away.)  
Realistically, most hand-kiting builds have little room for such tools, or simply aren't a position to use them (many would need you to be close to the action), so it's not something people expect of a hand-kiter (like healing/buffing your teammates, this is an optional extra thing you can do that people probably won't even notice, but would help if you've got some free time and mental overhead) so don't worry about it until you're a much more experienced kiter.  
Just be aware it's a thing you might have the freedom to do one day when you've mastered everything else in the fight and are looking for something else to do that could help the team even just a tiny bit.


# Boss Fight Mechanics
As a hand-kiter, you've only got to worry about a few mechanics throughout the entire encounter, and they're very predictable.

## The Hands ([Soul Feast][mechanic: hands])
Every 10 seconds, Deimos will choose the person who's furthest away from them and then for the next 5 seconds they'll get a hand spawn under them every second.
Your primary job is to stay the furthest from Deimos at all times (or at least at the moments when the next batch of hands is about to start spawning) so that you always get these hands spawning under you and not under some poor teammate in glassy DPS gear or whatever.
So you'll get 5 seconds of hands spawning under you, and then you'll get a 5 second reprieve to patch yourself up (and collect your thoughts, maybe grab a [tear][mechanic: tear] if it's close enough, or reposition to somewhere else useful on the platform to stay furthest away from Deimos).

At the 75%, 50%, and 25% phases - when the core group has come back from the other platform with Saul, the hands on the platform will start to move towards Deimos for 5 seconds.  
Interestingly, it seems not all stacks of hands will move towards him: I find that a lot of the time, many of the oldest stacks of hands won't move at all (they'll still despawn after 5s like all the others - they just don't move anywhere before they do).  
Also, the hands that have already spawned as part of your current batch won't move in either (e.g. if you've had 3 hands spawn under you already, and there's 2 more to go when the hands start moving, the 3 you've already had from this stack won't move). I believe a full batch of 5 has to be completely spawned before it's eligible to move in towards Deimos.

For every hand that reaches Deimos, he'll get a stacking damage buff called [Devour][mechanic: devour] which increases his damage by 2% per stack and lasts for the rest of the fight. This is obviously extremely threatening if the gets too many stacks.  
As previously mentioned, keeping hands away from your teammates is higher priority then keeping them away from Deimos, but it's crucial to bear this in mind too and not forget it. Letting him get too many stacks is incredibly hard to recover from, as even the passive boss damage aura becomes burdonsome.

It's worth me noting that I believe this 'hands moving in' mechanic accounts for nearly as many failures from aspiring hand-kiters as getting hit by [Mind Crush][mechanic: mind crush].  
It's very easy to get flustered by all the very high-damage AoEs suddenly moving under you (and they can be surprisingly threatening during this, as your 5-stacks will start to converge, so you risk touching where they overlap and getting hit by 10 hands at once).  
When I was starting out, there were many occasions where I'd panic as the hands would start moving in when I was still counting hands in a current stack, or halfway through enacting a [Mind Crush][mechanic: mind crush] survival plan.   
Nowadays, while the core group is off on the other platform fighting Saul, I generally go on 'high alert' as it gets close to their return, and I try to pre-plan roughly where I'll move and which direction(s) I'll dodge to get through the hands safely (without just dodge rolling off the edge of the platform to my death - which I have done several times before in a panicked response to the hands suddenly moving and me being mentally unprepared).  
The goal is simply to reduce the amount of things I have to improvise on the fly, and to help me keep a calm and clear head (your build usually affords you answers to every combination of mechanics that can occur in the fight, so you just have to remain clear-headed enough to see and enact them, and pre-planning helps me a lot with that).

### Tips & Advice

#### Positioning the Hands
The general idea is to try and place them around the edges of the platform, and if you need to, then up to one 'inner layer/ring' - ideally no further in (unless you're doing 'ranged strat' - in which case you've got more breathing room, but should still aim to keep the hands back so they don't reach your teammates or drive them forward into the oils between them and Deimos).  
This way, if Deimos is in the very center of the platform, he shouldn't be reached. (Generally, the tank won't need to move him there exactly, but it means it *is* often feasible to position him to avoid the hands.)

In order to make the most of the space around the edge of the platform, you'll want to aim to 'stack' each batch of hands - ideally as '5-stacks' where all 5 hands in a batch are stacked atop eachother so they only take up the same amount of space a single hand would (though of course it'll hit 5 times harder, so you'll need to be careful to avoid touching them unecessarily).  

If you 5-stack consistently, you won't often have to start an 'inner layer/ring' of hands, and will only have them right at the edge of the platform.  
This relies on your teammates doing decent dps to Deimos, but when I say that I'm not talking SnowCrows level dps - just usual pug clear speed amounts of it. (If your group is struggling, you'll have to make the 'inner layer/ring' but it's not a big deal - they still won't quite reach the center of the platform.)

#### Stacking the Hands
In order to 5-stack consistently and safely, you'll want to be aware of how much of the stack's damage comes from each 'tick' of the hands (I think of the 5 hands that spawn as 'the 5 ticks of a stack' - so the 5th tick is when the 5th hand spawns).  
Since you have 1 hand spawn at a time, every second for 5 seconds, you'll take 15 individual hits from hands during the formation of a full 5-stack:  
1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 = 15

If you were to use a single block effect like Aegis, you'd only block one hit from a hand, so you'd still take 14 of the 15 hits.  
If you were to use a 'duration-based' block like [Warding Rift][skill: warding rift] though, you could use that to block the last 2s worth of hands - so the 4th and 5th 'ticks'. This would mean you'd take the first 3 'ticks' and then block the 4th and 5th to avoid 9 of the hits in total, so you've only taken 6 of the 15 hits for this stack. That's a huge 60% damage reduction!  
This is a large part as to why Herald and Scrapper are good hand-kiters, they both have access to a duration-based block they can use frequently (the cooldowns for [Warding Rift][skill: warding rift] and [Gear Shield][skill: gear shield] are short enough that they can use them every other stack of hands), and these blocks make stacking hands trivially easy and safe (so much so that your passive sustain will be enough to outheal the 6 hits you took, so you only really have to worry about the hand stacks where you don't have the block available).

While most builds won't have access to a duration-based block on such short cooldowns, some have evades on short cooldowns, and every profession has access to dodge rolls, and simply dodging off the stack on the 5th tick will avoid 5 of the 15 hits - so a 33% damage reduction.  
This is an easy and safe (unless you dodge roll off the edge of the platform!) way to reduce hand damage in every profession and build.  
The only thing to mention here is that if you're going to rely on dodges heavily, you may benefit from having a bit of extra endurance regen of some kind. You don't *need* it as you've got 10s between dodges, and base endurance regen should get you one dodge worth of endurance every 10s, but clearly this doesn't leave much wiggle room for mistakes (like dodging when you really didn't need to actually) or wanting to use a dodge to go through hands as they move towards Deimos or whatever, but not having spare endurance for it.  
When you're not doing Deimos CM, Saul's heal banner might give you enough sustain that you can afford to just tank the 5th tick and not use a dodge roll every now and then (allowing you to 'save a dodge for later'), so it's not as tight as it could be - I just wanted to point out that if you have the choice of getting some free endurance regen it might be worth taking (e.g. Scrappers can choose to take the [Adrenal Implant][trait: adrenal implant] trait at a very low opportunity cost (the alternative is very underwhelming), but are actually one of the builds that doesn't usually benefit from it anyway because they can use [Gear Shield][skill: gear shield] to block half of their stacks, so only have to dodge half as often as most builds).

So in summary, evades and duration-based blocks are excellent for mitigating damage from a stack (single-use blocks like Aegis and charge-based blocks like [Arcane Shield][skill: arcane shield] are of little use), and simply dodging off a stack at the 5th tick will save you from a whole third of the stack's potential damage - reducing the amount of self-healing you'll have to do - making your life easier and safer.  
If all else fails though, you can split the stack into say a 3 and 2 or spread it right out into 5 1-stacks; it's more important that you survive to continue getting the hands for your team than it is to make a perfect 5-stack every single time.

## Mind Crush
Every roughly 35 seconds (5 seconds of wind-up, with a 30 second cooldown), Deimos will do a big attack that downs everyone in the area unless they're protected by:

* Standing in the blue bubble in the center of the arena (on CM this doesn't exist)
* 'Blocking' the attack (e.g. you could use…)
	* 'Duration-based' blocks like [Warding Rift][skill: warding rift]
	* 'Charge-based' blocks like [Arcane Shield][skill: arcane shield]
	* 'Single-use' blocks like [Aegis][boon: aegis] or [Illusionary Riposte][skill: illusionary riposte]
* 'Taking no damage' from the attack using something like [Endure Pain][skill: endure pain] or [Stone Signet][skill: stone signet]
* 'Damage inversion' skills like [Infuse Light][skill: infuse light] or [Defiant Stance][skill: defiant stance]
* 'Don't die' due to something like [Rebound][skill: rebound], [A.E.D.][skill: aed] or [Eternal Bond][trait: eternal bond]

Note that you **cannot** survive the attack with an 'evade' or 'invulnerability' effect.  
So dodging won't save you, nor will using something like [Phase Smash][skill: phase smash], [Distortion][effect: distortion] or [Elixir S][skill: elixir s]

Since you're keeping the hands away from the rest of your team, you obviously can't go stand in the bubble in the middle with everyone else, so you'll need to use a block or 'take no damage effect' to survive.  
Surviving this attack applies a debuff to you called [Weak Minded][mechanic: weak minded] for 10 seconds that damages you for 7% of your max health every second (so over the next 10s you'll lose 70% of your max health).

This is the single biggest threat to your survivability - not the hands (the hands are actually quite forgiving because you can spread them out if needed), nor the [tears][mechanic: tear] (as they're not an issue unless most of the group isn't picking them up regularly).  
This attack will one-shot you if you're not paying attention or have your cooldowns ready, or the damage-over-time afterwards will cause the next batch of hands to finish you off anyway.

As hand-kiter, you'll want a plan for how you'll survive the initial attack, and how you'll heal yourself to make up the extra 70% of your health over the next hand stack. (Make sure that your plan can be done every 30-35 seconds, so that you'll always have it ready off cooldown for each time he does this attack.)  
E.g. On a Herald, I block the [Mind Crush][mechanic: mind crush] itself with [Crystal Hibernation][skill: crystal hibernation], and then use the Glint heal [Infuse Light][skill: infuse light] to outheal [Weak Minded][mechanic: weak minded] by inverting the bulk of the damage coming in from the next stack of hands - healing me back up to full (generally leaving me back up at or near full health by the time [Weak Minded][mechanic: weak minded] has worn off (if I have to use it a bit earlier than planned, then often much of the [Weak Minded][mechanic: weak minded] debuff applies after the damage-inversion, so then I just use the Ventari tablet's [Natural Harmony][skill: natural harmony] to heal the remaining damage)).

## Tears ([Demonic Tear][mechanic: tear])
After Deimos gets below 75% health, he'll spawn a [Demonic Tear][mechanic: tear] every 15 seconds.  
These will spawn somewhere on the platform, and it'll throw projectiles at people - doing a decent chunk of damage each time.

When someone walks over one, they'll destroy it, get a debuff called [Tear Instability][mechanic: tear instability] which applies a small damage-over-time and makes the player unable to destroy any more tears for a minute.  
This means the team will need at least 4 people picking up the tears, but realistically you'll want almost everyone making a point to go and pick them up.
*FYI: The damage-over-time is so small I hadn't even realised it existed until I read about it on the wiki - so don't worry about it at all, it's basically non-existent.*

One or two of these aren't much of a threat, but outsustaining several will start to take some actual concentration, and may end up with you needing to start spreading your hands out, so it's important that people pick these up so they don't become an issue.  
Personally, I try and avoid picking them up shortly before the 75%, 50% and 25% phases - as that's when most of the team will go to the other platform and won't be around to pick up the new [tears][mechanic: tear] that'll appear while they're gone.  
If you've already picked one up and can't pick up any for a while whilst the rest of the team is gone, then that's one more tear that can start to cause issues for the tank, oil-kiter and/or yourself.  
So I generally recommend trying to let the core group pick up all the [tears][mechanic: tear] as Deimos nears these phases, so you're free to pick up one of the ones that'll appear whilst they're gone (hopefully one spawns vaguely near you). I find this makes the phases a bit safer, though I must admit I feel kinda petty watching people come to pick up [tears][mechanic: tear] that're near me when I *could* do it myself (I know I've got a good reason for it, it just *feels* bad - as I worry that I appear lazy).

If you are picking up tears when you can, and your teammates are slacking on them (usually when they're greeding for DPS numbers) and you end up getting chunked down by several tears then don't feel bad - it's pretty-much the only mechanic outside your control. Sometimes you just can't do anything about it, and you'll just have to (politely) remind people to pick up tears as the supports can't usually do them all themselves.

## Heal Banner
If you're doing the normal version of the fight (not the CM) then every 20s or so, Saul will spawn a banner near the lowest-health player.  
This banner has a large AoE and heals everyone within it for 5% of their maximum hp every second for 15s.  
It's a tremendously powerful sustained AoE heal, and it'll often spawn near you (because at the time Saul checks who's lowest health, there's a decent chance you'll have taken a good chunk of damage from some hands or [Weak Minded][mechanic: weak minded]).  
Due to the unreliable nature of how it chooses who to spawn near, I advise you never assume that you'll have its help - you should have a build and plan that allows you to play as if you'll never get the banner. But you *can* safely make plans for how you can be more efficient or safer when you *do* have it healing you.

For example, often when it's healing me, I can afford to simply stand and tank all 5 ticks of a stack and walk off it after the 5th tick, then let the banner and my passive sustain (mostly regen) heal me back to full. I often don't have to use [Natural Harmony][skill: natural harmony] at all during these moments, and so I can save the energy I would have spent on that for later.  
(Some builds like Soulbeast have a relatively fixed amount they can heal for (it passively regens like 1000hp/s, but doesn't have many 'active' heals that it could save for when it needs the health), so can't take advantage of the heal banner as well as something like a Herald can (though to be fair, Herald is the best at that).)

## Oils
Since you've already done this fight from other roles, you'll already be very familiar with the oils, so I won't go into detail on how they work as you'll already know and they should almost never be relevant to you.

Once in a blue moon, the 75, 50 and 25% phases can have everyone except the tank and yourself go down to the other platform - leaving you to get the oils until they're back. This isn't an issue for you really, as you can continue staying at the edge of the platform and the oils will drop with you - well away from the main group and the center of the platform.
You'll obviously need to be careful to move out of them before they spawn, and I'm just gonna say this because it should be obvious but I've seen people mess this up (presumably because they were in a bit of a panic and couldn't think stright): The oils always take priority over stacking hands neatly!  
If you're starting a stack and the oil AoE appears on you - just immediately move out and drop your remaining hands somewhere else. Slightly messed up stacks is nothing compared to staying in the oil for too long - letting it expand and kill everyone.

The one awful possible situation is where you're using Herald and Deimos is doing a [Mind Crush][mechanic: mind crush] while oils can spawn on you (and you get one appear while you're in [Crystal Hibernation][skill: crystal hibernation] as you can't move out of the oil without cancelling the block and dying to the attack).  
These situations are extremely rare (you'd need to be getting the oils, have a [Mind Crush][mechanic: mind crush] building, and not had an oil spawn for just the right amount of time that it comes in just before the Mind Crush pops), but I've had this occur twice.  
I died the first time it happened (I didn't realise the oil would spawn while I was in [Crystal Hibernation][skill: crystal hibernation], and by the time the oil appeared, I was panicked and too slow to activate [Infuse Light][skill: infuse light]).  
The second time I'd learned from the first and knew to save my staff block ([Warding Rift][skill: warding rift]) and not swap to shield, so I could use the staff to block [Mind Crush][mechanic: mind crush] instead - as it let me walk out of the oil that was spawning at the same time.

My point here was just that it's kind of a perfect storm of bad things, so don't worry about it, but it can happen if your build wants to be stationary to survive [Mind Crush][mechanic: mind crush].

Other than that situation, there isn't really anything to worry about with the oils as they'll probably never go to you, and even when they do you'll usually be fine to just move out of them and handle [Mind Crush][mechanic: mind crush] if they happen around the same time.

## Prides

# Builds
Every profession can kite hands successfully - they've all got tools to sustain themselves and survive [Mind Crush][mechanic: mind crush], but as with basically everything else - some professions have mechanics or design philosophies that better lend themselves to this than others.  
I'm not going to cover niche builds and pretend kiting on a necro is as easy as on a soulbeast, nor am I intending to make this a thing of 'this is **the** hand-kiting build - just use this and don't question it'.  
I'll cover what I consider each of the main builds for the following professions and I'll discuss variations and possible alternatives that could be used as you see fit.

My philosophy with hand-kiting is 'if you're 5-stacking consistently and not dying, there's not much more you can do to *kite harder*, so consider making adjustments to make things safer and more reliable', and I think some choices I make with the builds reflect this.

## Herald
The all-round best hand-kiting build in both the community's eyes and my own.  
I've done almost all my kiting on Herald and would recommend it as the go-to option for most people unless they're looking to trade some hand-kiting ability for something else in particular (e.g. Scrappers can help rez people remotely, Tempests can splash heals around Deimos if he's within 1200 range, etc.).

#### Explanation of Traits

We're going to be using the Ventari tablet to do most of our sustaining, and we've got blocks for [Mind Crush][mechanic: mind crush] on the weapons, so the second legend is basically just optional.  
We're running Herald over core Revenant or Renegade because the Glint legend provides the [Infuse Light][skill: infuse light] heal skill - which you can use to either survive the [Mind Crush][mechanic: mind crush] attack itself or stack a batch of 5 hands while fully-healing to recover after the [Weak Minded][mechanic: weak minded] debuff eats most of our health. It's such a strong skill it's basically worth taking the Glint legend and Herald line specifically for it. (Though it does have some useful other benefits we'll get to in a minute.)

##### [Salvation][traitline: salvation]
We take this because it obviously pairs with the Ventari legend and tablet nicely.  
In particular, we primarily want it because it provides perma-regen with [Nourishing Roots][trait: nourishing roots] (and when we're in Glint, the [Facet of Light][skill: facet of light] covers it for us).  
We also benefit a bit from the extra healing power from [Hardened Foundation][trait: hardened foundation] (we benefit from the toughness too, but since we can't go over the tank's toughness number, this just subtracts from our gear's 'toughness budget'), the alacrity from [Serene Rejuvenation][trait: serene rejuvenation] (shaves a few seconds off [Infuse Light][skill: infuse light], but doesn't make a difference to anything else we use) and the free healing 'seeds' from [Natural Abundance][trait: natural abundance].  
Outgoing heal modifiers are great when our job is healing the team, but since we've got to prioritise keeping ourselves alive, and we'll rarely have the tablet near people - ready to heal them when needed - then we're better off taking the more selfish traits than outgoing modifiers.  
([Invoking Harmony][trait: invoking harmony] is the exception because the other traits available there make literally no difference to you anyway (no condis get applied during the Deimos encounter unless you've been hit by his knockbacks, and since you live on the edge of the platform, those'll kill you anyway, and there's nothing for you to attack with the staff autos to make buffing their healing orbs do anything for you).)

##### [Herald][traitline: herald]
Of course, we have to take Herald in order to use the elite spec, but even if we didn't *have* to use it, we'd want it anyway because improving our passive sustain a bit with [Elder's Respite][trait: elder's respite] is nice, as is the 8% free boon duration from [Reinforced Potency][trait: reinforced potency], and [Draconic Echo][trait: draconic echo] is great for extending the duration of your Glint facets to extend our Protection uptime.  
The [Hardening Persistence][trait: hardening persistence] trait is basically just a filler, as you'll be too far away from the group to have anyone benefit from [Shared Empowerment][trait: shared empowerment], and I find that I only proc [Shining Aspects][trait: shining aspects] when I activate [Infuse Light][skill: infuse light] which fully heals me anyway, so it's just a waste of a slot. So a 7% damage reduction while I'm waiting to activate [Infuse Light][skill: infuse light] is better than nothing.

##### [Retribution][traitline: retribution]
Our third trait line is somewhat flexible, but honestly I always go with [Retribution][traitline: retribution] because the extra damage reduction and sustain it provides is more meaningful to your survival (and thus you completing your role successfully) than anything the other traitline can provide.

The projectiles from tears are unblockable, so you can't occasionally protect yourself from them with [Planar Protection][trait: planar protection], so [Close Quarters][trait: close quarters] is the way to go.  
The middle set of options doesn't give you anything to reduce damage, resustain, or synergise with anything else we do, so you can pick whatever you want here really. I just go with [Retaliatory Evasion][trait: retaliatory evasion] because it does a tiny amount of damage to Deimos.

When I first started kiting I used to use [Versed in Stone][trait: versed in stone] because I thought it was a good idea to have as a safety net for when I mess up stacking the hands, but I ended up realising that I didn't need it for the hands - I was most vulnerable after [Mind Crush][mechanic: mind crush] while I was losing loads of health to [Weak Minded][mechanic: weak minded].  
The trait would proc when I was waiting for the hands to stack up so I could use [Infuse Light][skill: infuse light] to heal back up to full. Unfortunately, while this gave me a bit more time before needing to activate my heal, it'd also reduce the amount of healing I'd get (as I was reducing the incoming damage from the hands too much to fully heal reliably).  
I realised this wasn't really being a 'life saver', and I was just having it interfere in every second [Infuse Light][skill: infuse light], so I swapped it to [Steadfast Rejuvenation][trait: steadfast rejuvenation] - which is what I'd wholeheartedly recommend now.

[Steadfast Rejuvenation][trait: steadfast rejuvenation] provides about 80hp/s per energy you're upkeeping - so while I'm in Glint I've got [Face of Nature - Dragon][skill: facet of nature - dragon] and [Facet of Chaos][skill: facet of chaos] going all the time, and [Facet of Light][skill: facet of light] up most of the time, so usually 7 energy which represents >550hps/s.  
This represents a bunch of free health at precisely the time I most want it - when I'm in Glint, so I can't just heal myself with the tablet so I'm probably waiting to either pop [Infuse Light][skill: infuse light] (so it buys me more time before I have to use it) or after I've done that and I'm just waiting to get back to Ventari.

Finally, the combination of [Unwavering Avoidance][trait: unwavering avoidance] and [Determined Resolution][trait: determined resolution] gives you very situational access to Stability and while that's on you, an extra 15% damage reduction.  
This basically gives you a temporary damage reduction whenever you dodge roll off/through hands, which is nice in theory but I find it largely irrelevant as I find that if I'm dodging off hands, it's usually as I dodge off the 5th hand tick - so there's no new hands for several seconds and the Stability wears off before it gets to help with the next hand stack.  
You *can* proc it by dodging through some hands at the start of a new stack, but I don't bother with that as if I'm going to spend endurance on a dodge, I'd rather the dodge be used for the 5th hand tick instead - as that represents avoiding 1/3rd of the damage from the hand stack, while the Stability reduction would only be for 15%.

##### Alternatives
If you're finding survival trivially easy and want to trade some of that survivability for extra squad damage, then you can swap your staff for a hammer, and use the [Devastation][traitline: devastation] line for [Assassin's Annihilation][trait: assassin's annihilation]. It provides some nice sustain as long as you can consistently reach an enemy (ideally Deimos).  
You can also use [Assasin's Presence][trait: assassin's presence] - combining it with [Phase Smash][skill: phase smash] to get close and spread the buff to people (in between stacks of hands, as you don't want to drop one close to people).  
I wouldn't run the [Devastation][traitline: devastation] line without the hammer, nor would I run the hammer without the [Devastation][traitline: devastation] line. They just go together so well, and nothing else can make much use of either of them individually.

The [Invocation][traitline: invocation] line looks interesting for personal survivability, but I find it underwhelming compared to [Retribution][traitline: retribution].  
The minor and adept traits are entirely unhelpful, but let's look at some potentially useful options:

* [Spirit Boon][trait: spirit boon] - Provides a little extra Protection and Regeneration uptime, but we already have perma-regen (and nothing worth taking instead, so this wouldn't 'free us up to take something else') and getting 5-6 seconds more Protection is nice but not a big deal.
* [Rapid Flow][trait: rapid flow] - Provides about 500 health on a 5s cooldown when you spend energy on a skill, so this is basically some extra sustain for when you use your Ventari tablet skills. This is alright, but the internal cooldown just made it a bit awkward for me to get the most value out of (I like to move the tablet about the same time I'm using [Natural Harmony][skill: natural harmony], so only one of those was getting the benefit from this trait, and I was spending time thinking about it during the fight when I'd rather be paying more attention to my team's health, tear locations, etc.).
* [Song of the Mists][trait: song of the mists] - The effect you get going into Glint ([Call of the Dragon][trait: song of the mists - dragon]) doesn't help us at all, but the Ventari one is nice ([Call of the Centaur][trait: song of the mists - centaur]) as it gives a >3k health burst heal.  
My issue with it is simply that almost every time I'm swapping back to Ventari, it's shortly after using [Infuse Light][skill: infuse light], so I'm already at basically full health.  
It can be nice in some situations where I've had to use [Infuse Light][skill: infuse light] very quickly after [Crystal Hibernation][skill: crystal hibernation] but those situations arise because the 'Glint hand stack' spawned just as the block was ending - which means that by the time the next stack gets to the 4th or 5th tick I'll already be back on Ventari and staff so can block it with [Warding Rift][skill: warding rift] and resustain with [Natural Harmony][skill: natural harmony]. So I very rarely found this useful in real encounters - it just looked nice on paper.
* [Charged Mists][trait: charged mists] - I've always been a fan of this trait, and love builds that can make great use of it, but I find that this just doesn't help me in any meaningful way.  
I'm already able to use both shield skills and maintain all the defensive facets while I'm in Glint, so there's nothing else I could want extra energy for there. On the other hand, Ventari could always benefit from extra energy (it can always convert it to Alacrity via [Natural Harmony][skill: natural harmony] and [Serene Rejuvenation][trait: serene rejuvenation]) but I don't want to be devoting mental overhead to trying to get a little more energy out of Ventari when I'm wrapping up in Glint (I want to be using [True Nature (dragon)][skill: true nature - dragon] and [Chaotic Release][skill: chaotic release] before swapping, and getting my energy low enough to use them but then still have <10 energy immediately afterwards is doable but requires concentration and more careful timing than I'm comfortable affording it when I'd rather be counting hand ticks or checking on teammates' health and whatnot).

So overall, I find [Invocation][traitline: invocation] to have some interesting stuff, but it's largely irrelevant things that either proc at inopportune moments or don't help me enough in the situations where I'll benefit most from them (like healing me when I'm usually at full health or just a second away from big heals anyway, but doing nothing to heal me while I'm getting dangerously low - waiting to get the most from [Infuse Light][skill: infuse light]).  
Thus I still recommend [Retribution][traitline: retribution] because if nothing else, [Steadfast Rejuvenation][trait: steadfast rejuvenation] is great and provides a solid amount of health when I benefit most from it (as I'm always using a bunch of upkeep on the Glint facets while [Weak Minded][mechanic: weak minded] is on me), but feel free to swap it for [Devastation][traitline: devastation] if that's more up your alley.

### Skills
Since it's a Revenant, you just pick the Ventari and Glint legends and you've got your skills sorted.

#### Explanation of Skills


### How to play it
Due to Revenant's [energy][mechanic: revenant energy] mechanic, you're able to do something basically no other build can: be incredibly flexible on when you use your main resustain skill ([Natural Harmony][skill: natural harmony]).  
All hand-kiting builds have passive and active heals, and different builds have different strengths in this regard (e.g. Soulbeasts and Scrappers have better passive healing than a Herald, but the Herald has better active healing).  
The strength of Herald's active heals lies in:  
1. The amount of health you get from [Natural Harmony][skill: natural harmony] in relation to its effective cooldown (it only takes 4s to generate the 20 energy you need to use it - which is quite a lot quicker than comperable heals other professions have access to).  
2. The ability for you to choose not to heal for a while if you don't need it - allowing you to build up the energy and save it for later when you will want it.

This ability to 'save heals for later' is the main benefit that makes Herald the top hand-kiter, as a lot of the time you simply won't need to use a big heal for one reason or another (maybe Saul's heal banner is on you, or you've taken almost no damage from a hand stack (because you've blocked most of it with [Warding Rift][skill: warding rift])).  
This lets you accumulate energy for later, and with the short <2s cooldown on [Natural Harmony][skill: natural harmony] (it's less than 2s because it also gives you Alacrity - so it's really more like 1.6s) you're able to dump large amounts of energy into big heals in a short time.  
No other build can do this nearly as well. They're always contrained by cooldowns or a more limited resource like endurance (which works similar to energy, but you can't save up as many dodges as you can tablet heals or whatever).

My general plystyle for Herald is:

1. Camp Ventari and staff most of the time, using the block ([Warding Rift][skill: warding rift]) on every other stack of hands, and [Natural Harmony][skill: natural harmony] to patch up damage as required.
2. When Deimos starts preparing [Mind Crush][mechanic: mind crush], make sure you're at or nearly full on health then swap to Glint and shield.
3. Use the shield block ([Crystal Hibernation][skill: crystal hibernation]) to block the [Mind Crush][mechanic: mind crush] and whilst you're blocking, switch on the F2 and elite facet ([Facet of Nature - Dragon][skill: facet of nature - dragon] and [Facet of Chaos][skill: facet of chaos] respectively) to start stacking Protection on yourself.
4. You've got some time until you can swap back to Ventari, and you'll have the [Weak Minded][mechanic: weak minded] debuff on you, so prepare your heal skill by activating [Facet of Light][skill: facet of light] and depending on the state of the current batch of hands, you'll want to do slightly different things to get the most out of your heal ([Infuse Light][skill: infuse light]):
    * If you've got hands starting to spawn under you now, wait until the 3rd tick or so (or if you're getting low on health) and activate [Infuse Light][skill: infuse light] to absorb all the damage for the rest of the stack and move off it before it ends.
    * If you've already got a full 5-stack under you, dodge roll off it as the [Crystal Hibernation][skill: crystal hibernation] ends, and wait for the next start to start spawning, then use [Infuse Light][skill: infuse light] when you get lowish on health (often around the 2nd hand - as [Weak Minded][mechanic: weak minded] will have eaten much of your health by the time the new stack spawns, and you may have taken some hits as the shield block wore off - before the dodge roll evade starts).
    * If the stack of hands under you is roughly halfway done, you can make a judgment call as to whether you'd prefer to activate [Infuse Light][skill: infuse light] immediately and absorb this stack, or if you'd rather dodge roll off and drop the last hand or two separately - saving [Infuse Light][skill: infuse light] for the next stack.
    * You don't have to swap back to Ventari as soon as it's available, but since you'll be in Glint for at least 10 seconds, your aim is to use [Infuse Light][skill: infuse light] to stack the hands that'll occur within this period, then swap back to staff + Ventari.
5. Now that you've presumably used your [Infuse Light][skill: Infuse Light] to 5-stack the next batch of hands after [Mind Crush][mechanic: mind crush], you can consume your F2 and elite skills ([True Nature (dragon)][skill: true nature - dragon] and [Chaotic Release][skill: chaotic release] respectively) to keep their passive buffs for a bit longer (due to [Draconic Echo][trait: draconic echo]) before swapping back to Ventari and staff.
6. Now you're back to step 1 and can repeat this same cycle over and over without issue (the cooldowns for your weapon and legend swap, as well as [Crystal Hibernation][skill: crystal hibernation] and [Infuse Light][skill: infuse light] will be available by the next time you need them).

General tips for this build and playstyle:

* When stacking hands on staff + Ventari, I would generally just stand and count the hands as they spawn, then after the 4th hand hit [Natural Harmony][skill: natural harmony] and move off the stack just after the 5th hand spawns (the heal then procs and I got back to basically full health immediately after the 5th hand tick).
	* You could dodge roll off the stack at the 5th tick - like other hand-kiting builds often want to do (e.g. Soulbeast), but I rarely feel the need to, so I rarely do.  
	* (I'm usually in mostly Minstrel gear, so have plenty of toughness and Saul's heal banner, so I don't have to use [Natural Harmony][skill: natural harmony] that much, thus I have plenty of energy and can afford to just tank all 15 hits from a stack of hands and patch myself up after. This isn't the most efficient way to do things, but it works for me and avoids me having to do a dodge roll and risk angling it stupidly - rolling off the edge of the platform. (I've messed that up enough times that I now try and avoid dodging if I don't need to, and Herald is so strong that I can actually comfortably afford to make that choice.))
* When you're on shield + Glint, you can use shield 4 ([Envoy of Exuberance][skill: envoy of exuberance]) when you have a quiet moment for a little bit of extra self-healing and Protection uptime (you'll have the energy available for this, so it's just free healing and Protection).
* When you're on shield + Glint, you could theoretically spend as much time as you can in Glint before swapping back, as it gives you more Protection uptime, but I find getting back to Ventari sooner and building up energy in that legend to be safer and more forgiving (I believe extra energy for [Natural Harmony][skill: natural harmony] is more valuable than extra Protection uptime).
* When you're on shield + Glint, you may have taken a fair bit of damage from the hands you were blocking on top of, so you might want to spread out a couple of hands or activate [Infuse Light][skill: infuse light] early and walk back onto a recent 5-stack to fully heal yourself. This should be a bit of a last resort really, as if you do this too soon, you won't have anything left to stack new the hands until you've gotten back to staff + Ventari.
* [Facet of Nature - Centaur][skill: facet of nature - centaur] plus [Steadfast Rejuvenation][trait: steadfast rejuvenation] heals for roughly the same amount as [Natural Harmony][skill: natural harmony] would for the same amount of energy, so it's got a good heals/energy ratio.  
However, I find it safer to avoid using this (unless I'm basically at the 100 energy cap) as spending energy on this is often 'wasted' by me already being at full health (due to using [Warding Rift][skill: warding rift], standing in Saul's heal banner, etc.) and it's good to have a healthy reserve of energy for if things go awry somehow (e.g. maybe you're fine but your teammates are struggling because their main healer went down with the green without most of them, so you suddenly need a bunch of extra energy to sink into healing them too).
* When I'm on particularly tanky gear (e.g. mostly Minstrel stats) I often don't bother using [Warding Rift][skill: warding rift] for 5-stacking, as I've learned that generally I don't need to.  
If I'm at roughly full health and energy, maybe with the heal banner on me, then just one [Natural Harmony][skill: natural harmony] will usually patch up all the damage anyway, so there's really no benefit in me using the block when I could instead be saving it for something else that comes up (like using it to 5-stack while I've sent the tablet away to heal my teammates - that's something I find very useful).
* Don't worry about having to use [Natural Harmony][skill: natural harmony] rarely for some stacks and multiple times for others - that's normal.  
It only costs 20 energy, which is 4 seconds' worth, and hands appear on 10 second cycles, so you can use it twice on every hand stack and *still* end up ahead (20 + 20 + 5 (to reposition the tablet each new stack) = 45 (so you'll still net 5 energy anyway)).
* On stacks where you use [Warding Rift][skill: warding rift] to block the 4th and 5th ticks, you'll likely not have to use [Natural Harmony][skill: natural harmony] at all, and then you've gained 35 energy during that stack of hands, so you can afford one or two more [Natural Harmonys][skill: natural harmony] on the next stack when you won't have [Warding Rift][skill: warding rift].  
The ability to do 2 big heals per stack, or 1 (or 0) for one stack with [Warding Rift][skill: warding rift] and then 3 or 4 big heals for the next stack is what makes Herald such a good kiter. This flexibility is great so don't worry if you feel like you're needing a lot of [Natural Harmony][skill: natural harmony] uses on some stacks - you're probably still generating enough energy to keep on top of things.

# General Tips

## Gearing
Since Deimos aggros on whoever has the most toughness, and you don't want to be the tank, you'll need to either run little-to-no toughness, or be flexible in how you gear your character.  
Generally, I'd recommend to start with Magi gear and then work on a set with a lot more toughness (Minstrel, Givers, Cleric, or Nomad). Then you can always have lower toughness than your tank, and once you know how much they have, you can simply swap in as much toughness gear as you can afford in your 'toughness budget' to make your job easier.

### Stat Combinations
Minstrels is the all-round best stat combination for basically every class and build.  
All 4 stats are relevant and in the order you benefit from them the most - Healing Power and Toughness as primary stats makes you take less damage and resustain better, then Concentration helps you keep high or permanent uptime on Protection and Regen, and some Vitality gives you some breathing room to make mistakes (playing a build without some Vitality is… exciting when things go sideways).  
Since it has Toughness as a stat (and a lot of it!) it risks you having too much and becoming the tank, so this is why you should start with Magi and swap in Minstrel pieces from there.

Givers is a good budget replacement for Minstrel, as Vitality is the least important of the stats and you'll likely be combining it with a bunch of Magi gear so you'll get some vitality and extra healing power from that. So Magi with some Givers gear available to swap in is probably the best way to kite on a budget, but if you're looking to min-max then Magi + Minstrel is slightly better.

I don't really recommend Cleric or Nomad stats because they don't have any Concentration, so with Magi and these stats you'll often not have much boon duration on your build so may struggle to maintain perma Regen or meaningful Protection uptime (you don't need Protection to be permanent, but ideally you'll at least want it while you'll be taking heavy damage and more is always better).  
They're cheaper and easier to obtain than Minstrel and Givers though, so I don't begrudge people using them - I'm just saying that most kiting builds benefit quite a bit from extra boon duration (e.g. Soulbeast really wants perma Protection for its amazing passive heal from [Rugged Growth][trait: rugged growth]).

Harrier is something I'll mix in with a lot of Minstrel sometimes when I'm looking for more boon duration but can't increase my toughness further.  
If you're playing a low toughness build, it's probably better to stick with Magi gear rather than start mixing in Harrier unless you really need specific boon uptimes (like Soulbeast is designed around perma-Protection). Otherwise you'll lack both the damage-reduction of toughness stats, as well as the health buffer of vitality, and it'll be like you're on a razor's edge the whole time - one tiny mistake and you'll go down.

It's worth thinking about your build and how it works exactly, to work out the relative value of different stat combinations.  
For example, since Minstrel has so much toughness, and Magi gear does not, a full Minstrel kiter is going to be taking about a third less damage than a Magi one (that's like having another form of Protection with 100% uptime).  
Most builds have so much self-healing that they don't really need this extra damage reduction, while others have fairly limited self-healing and so rely more on reducing incoming damage to keep below manageable levels.  
Heralds for example, have such strong active heals with [Natural Harmony][skill: natural harmony] and [Infuse Light][skill: infuse light] and frequent damage-negation with [Warding Rift][skill: warding rift] that their self-sustain is so high they can kite quite comfortably with no extra damage reduction from investing stats in toughness (they still find it easier, but they can get by fine without it).  
Soulbeasts on the other hand, are probably easier to play, but have a bit less self-sustain (they have better passive sustain, but Herald's actives are hard to beat - it's why they're the main hand-kiting build), so reducing the incoming damage is more important for them.  
So of course, the more self-sustain you have, the more damage you can survive, so the less you need to reduce the damage, so the less you'll need toughness. Most hand-kiting builds can use pure Magi with no issues, but some builds definitely find this easier than others, and as you look at builds with lower overall self-healing and damage mitigation, you'll want to consider trying to use high-toughness gear to make your life easier.

### Runes
Selecting runes depends largely on your build, so for specifics I'd suggest looking at your build's specific breakdown section, but I'll try and give a brief rundown of most rune options.

* [Durability][item: durability rune] - All-round great, these are possibly the single best runes for most builds, as they improve Protection and Regen uptime while giving you much-desired boon duration and plenty of defensive stats which are always nice. If your build doesn't care at all about Protection uptime, or already caps out on it, then these are superfluous, but otherwise they're great and well worth considering.
* [Water][item: water rune] - Basically an alternative to [Durability][item: durability rune] runes when you're already very close on the amount of Protection uptime you want (it obviously doesn't provide as much, but most builds benefit more from extra healing power than toughness and vitality (usually healing power scales better than toughness - especially when you've got multiple small heals)).
* [Monk][item: monk rune] - No real reason to use this over [Water][item: water rune] runes except that you can use these on normal healing builds to keep your team alive. Plenty of people kite with these and they still have good relevant stats, so they're never bad - just not quite as good as the alternatives would be.
* [Defender][item: defender rune] - If your build has some frequent blocks available, these could be great, and some people like them on builds like Herald and Scrapper, but personally I don't see the appeal.  
(I usually find I'm either using [Warding Rift][skill: warding rift] to block the 4th and 5th ticks of a stack (in which case the first 3 ticks don't do enough damage to justify these runes because my passive heals will patch up that small amount of damage even without the 10% health I'd get from these runes), or I'm blocking [Mind Crush][mechanic: mind crush] (and when I'm doing that I'm usually at full health), so the 10-15% of health I'd get from a 2s or 3s block just doesn't feel like it helps me at the times I'm actually needing it most (mainly after [Mind Crush][mechanic: mind crush] when [Weak Minded][mechanic: weak minded] is draining my health from 100-30%).)  
You might have more success with it, depending on how you play really. It just wasn't as useful for my playstyle as I'd hoped. (If it had boon duration it might be worth it, but it's so hard for my builds to justify this over [Durability][item: durability rune] or [Water][item: water rune] runes.)
* [Rebirth][item: rebirth rune] - Gives you a failsafe, and has nice stats, but it's such a small (roughly 4k) barrier that you'll likely die anyway - better to pick a rune that makes your job easier most of the time so you don't get into these panicked situations where you mess up and need this risky lifesaver anyway.
* [Dwayna][item: dwayna rune] - Buffs your regen, which sounds nice but no build gets enough from their regen to justify this (even Herald doesn't get enough out of this, and it already buffs regen with [Elder's Respite][trait: elder's respite]!).
* [Grove][item: grove rune] - Huge 50% Protection duration buff, but not mcuh else. The 6th tier bonus is on such a long cooldown that while it's strong (>15s of Protection if you can stand in its AoE the whole time) it's impractical.  
Most builds won't want this, but it could be used as a replacement for Earth runes on something like a Magi Soulbeast, as Magi lacks boon duration but Soulbeast should have enough Regen application to maintain that permanently anyway, and having 50% more Protection uptime could be enough to maintain the [Rugged Growth][trait: rugged growth] regen. (Haven't tested this myself to be certain though - so you'll want to double-check the math before diving in.)
* [Flock][item: flock rune] - I used to use [Water][item: water rune] as my primary hand-kiting runes on Herald back before the big Herald and rune reworks - back when Heralds could maintain perma-Protection trivially easily and [Water][item: water rune] runes had this 'do a small AoE heal when you use a heal skill (with a 10s cooldown' bonus.  
Now that's been split from [Water][item: water rune] runes and [Flock][item: flock rune] don't have any boon duration, I don't recommend these for any build (you'd need to already have all the boon uptime you might want, and have a very short cooldown heal skill, and I don't know of any build that can do that at the moment).
* [Dolyak][item: dolyak rune] - Thoroughly underwhelming. They heal about 80hps, don't scale off healing power, and it's just not worth it when other runes can give you more boons or healing power (which usually represents more than 80hps).
* [Herald][item: herald rune] - Fittingly, these can be a useful option for a Herald, as when you move the Ventari tablet regularly you'll give yourself some extra Protection uptime (probably better than [Durability][item: durability rune] runes). Other builds don't run heal skills with short enough cooldowns to justify the use of these over [Durability][item: durability rune] runes though, so beyond Herald I don't think there's a build these are great for.
* [Earth][item: earth rune] - Overall best in slot for Soulbeasts as their main weaknesses are their reliance on perma-Protection and that the vast majority of their healing is passive (so they have limited options to amp up their heals in periods where things are going awry and they're taking too much damage at once for their passive heals to keep up). This extends their Protection uptime nicely (not as well as [Grove][item: grove rune] runes, but 30% on their key boon is still great) and the 10% incoming heal bonus improves their passive sustain more than anything else would, and this helps reduce the number of situations where they have to use a precious active heal to cover the damage/heal differential.  
Other builds could use this, but the 10% heal modifier benefits small, frequent heals more than large, infrequent ones (as large heals are much more likely to 'overheal' so the extra 10% is wasted a lot more often than with smaller heals) and few builds have the right balance between really wanting extra Protection uptime and such strong passive heals.
* [Scrapper][item: scrapper rune] - The 7% damage reduction isn't worth the opportunity cost when excellent alternatives like [Durability][item: durability rune] runes exists.
* [Sanctuary][item: sanctuary rune] - These are kinda weird and depend very heavily on exactly how you heal yourself and when.  
Some 'passive' heals don't work (e.g. the Regeneration boon doesn't trigger it) but some do (e.g. [Rapid Regeneration][trait: rapid regeneration] does), but as a general rule of thumb all 'active' heals should trigger it (e.g. [Natural Harmony][skill: natural harmony]).  
I've not yet tested these, so I can't say whether these are actually worthwhile or not (I plan to get a set and try all the possible heals on these kiting builds and see what does and doesn't proc them and whether they work at full health or not (some traits that proc on self-heals (e.g. [Medical Dispersion Field][trait: medical dispersion field]) can proc while you're at full health and overhealing, while other heals won't proc that same trait unless they're actually healing damage you've taken - I want to know whether these runes have similar quirks with specific heals)).

### Sigils
Since sigils are generally offensive in nature, there's not many that can help you, and those that do often depend heavily on the build and how you play it. (For example 'on hit' or 'on crit' sigils can either be great or useless from one build and player to the next.)

* [Concentration][item: concentration sigil] - The overall best sigil for kiters in my opinion. I struggle to think of a build that won't want this, as every build wants perma-Regen, and many want high or perma-Protection and this represents 150 point of Concentration stats (which otherwise requires a lot of toughness (Minstrel and Giver) or wasted stats (Harrier)).
* [Renewal][item: renewal sigil] - Probably the second best sigil overall, but this is exactly the kind of sigil I was thinking of when I said 'it depends on your build and playstyle'.  
Something like a Scrapper can proc this basically off cooldown if they want to - or just accidentally proc it very often just by doing their usual actions and not have to think about this at all.  
I don't get as much use out of it on Herald though because I rarely swap legend or weapon and when I do I'm usually already at full health (or at least very close). It's a bit of free healing sometimes but it's never when I really need it, I just use it because there's really not any better options available (unless you're able to proc [Sigil of Blood][item: blood sigil] frequently).  
Some people use both a superior and a major version as they'll both proc on each weapon swap, but I don't see much point: It's a rare build indeed that doesn't benefit more from the extra boon duration from [Concentration][item: concentration sigil] more than the small heal of the major version of this sigil.
* [Energy][item: energy sigil] - Just like [Sigil of Renewal][item: renewal sigil] but if you're playing a build that likes to dodge hands but doesn't have as much endurance as you'd like (but could proc this often enough to be worth it) then this could be right up your alley.  
If you can use the extra endurance, the extra dodges you get from this will probably save you from much more damage than a [Sigil of Renewal][item: renewal sigil] sigil will heal.
I could see people using this on Scrapper if they don't want to to pick [Adrenal Implant][trait: adrenal implant], or on Soulbeast instead of [Renewal][item: renewal sigil] (especially if they are free to weapon swap frequently (i.e. just have axe & warhorn - no longbow or greatsword)).
* [Blood][item: blood sigil] - It's an alternative to [Sigil of Renewal][item: renewal sigil] if you have a long-range damage source you can use frequently, and are using mostly Magi gear to proc it consistently. If you *do* meet those requirements though, it's a plausible alternative (if you're not weapon swapping frequently, then this provides more overall healing and might be at more useful times).
* [Transference][item: transference sigil] - Like [Monk runes][item: monk rune], this doesn't help your kiting so much as just save you from having to make more gear. A [Transference][item: transference sigil] and [Concentration][item: concentration sigil] combo is pretty common in heal supports these days, and nobody will mind at all if you want to use those weapons for hand-kiting too.
* [Water][item: water sigil] - Like [Sigil of Transference][item: transference sigil], this doesn't help you but helps your teammates.  
Can be handy when you feel you've already got more than enough sustain and a long-range weapon to proc this near your teammates. (In these situations, it'll give more heals to your team than [Transference][item: transference sigil] since most builds can't heal your teammates most of the time (I's say Tempest is probably the only outlier, as the staff autos splash heals basically all the time).)

Generally with sigils I'd say you can't go far wrong with [Concentration][item: concentration sigil] and [Renewal][item: renewal sigil] but there's a few other options you can pick if your build and playstyle can make better use of them.

### Consumables
You'll want damage-reduction food and boon-duration utility (unless you're already maxxed on boon duration, but even then you can probably use the utility to free up some gear for some Magi pieces or something).

#### Damage-reduction food
Generally, [Plate of Mussels Gnashblade][item->food: plate of mussels gnashblade] or [Oysters with Pesto Sauce][item->food: oysters with pesto sauce] are what you'll want, as concentration and healing power are the main stats most builds can always use more of.  
Personally, I like to use [Bowl of Mussel Soup][item->food: bowl of mussel soup] when I'm on Herald with mostly Minstrel gear, as I've usually got enough boon duration and healing power to comfortably survive everything already. So I just go for a bit of extra vitality because if I'm going to die it's because I've messed up some things significantly along the way, and then the extra 700 health is more likely to catch me before I go down than going from 193% to 198% boon duration, or a tiny increase in healing power (when I already drastically outheal every damage source already).

My general rule of thumb is that if your build could do with more Protection uptime, then go for boon duration, if the build could do with more sustain or has more passive than active heals, then go for healing power, and if you've got more than enough of each them go for vitality for more buffer for mistakes.

#### Utilities
This is dead easy, go with whatever gives you the most boon duration.  
If you're in mostly Magi gear, that's probably [Peppermint Oil][item->utility: peppermint oil].  
If you're in mostly Minstrel gear it's probably [Magnanimous Maintenance Oil][item->utility: magnanimous maintenance oil].

### Obtaining Gear
Before anything else, it's worth making it clear that exotic gear is absolutely perfectly good for hand-kiting as you really don't gain much from trying to min/max a few stat points here and there. (Whether you survive or not won't depend on having 20 extra healing power or whatever, and as I've mentioned before, there isn't much benefit to optimisation as you can't really *kite harder* (at least, not like how a DPS player benefits from optimising because they can just *do more DPS*).)  
If you want to use ascended stuff because you've got it lying around then by all means feel free to - just don't worry about trying to gear up an ascended set of gear to feel like a 'proper' hand-kiter. That's daft and a huge waste of gold and time.  
The only exception is for Minstrel gear, as it needs a ton of [Freshwater Pearls][item: freshwater pearl] and they're just way too expensive to be worth crafting Minstrel gear at all. So if you're aiming for Minstrel gear then I recommend trying to avoid crafting it directly if you can, and that is usually about as easy or convenient with ascended as it is with exotic, so skipping straight to ascended there is perfectly reasonable.

The wiki has a handy page that lists practically every way to get each gear stat, and I'm not going to beat it or just repeat it so I'm just gonna mention some keys bits and pieces I found useful, and you can check the full wiki page if you need more specifics.  
[Equipment Aquisition by Stats][wiki: equipment aquisition by stats]

Exotic Magi gear is generally very easy to obtain, but trinkets can appear awkward - as they're not really craftable and needlessly expensive on the trading post, but they can be easily obtained for karma (42k each, so 252k for a full set of 6) from [Lightbringer Brutefur][npc: lightbringer brutefur] at the [Cathedral of Eternal Radiance][location: cathedral of eternal radiance] in [Malchor's Leap][location: malchor's leap] once the meta event for the temple has been done (basically, just look for the white dome protecting the NPCs - if that's up, you can buy from the karma vendor).  
Slap some [Crests of the Magi][item: crest of the magi] in them and you'll have a full set of magi trinkets sorted trivially easily and without spending a ton of gold on the trading post.

If you're working towards a full set of Minstrel gear (that you can swap in/out with your Magi set as desired), I'd recommend using either exotic armour or weapon boxes (e.g. from WvW or PvP reward tracks to get you stuff like [Triumphant Armor Box][item: triumphant armor box]) or waiting to get ascended gear (ideally without needing to craft any Minstrel inscriptions or insignias, such as by getting drops or buying 'Healers' or 'Defenders' stat-selectable gear from raids).

When I geared up my Herald, I used the [box of ascended armour][item: chest of experimental armor] you get from the [first collection for legendary armour][collection: envoy armor 1 - experimental armor] to get a full set of Minstrel armour. The first collection's armour isn't needed to craft the eventual legendary set, so it's just a free whole set you can use on any character for any reason.  
(i.e. If you'd eventually like to make the *light* legendary armour, you can use the 'experimental' set on a *heavy* class like Harald or *medium* class like Scrapper or Soulbeast and later you'll use the 'refined' armour box to get a *light* set of some kind - which you'll throw into the forge later as precursors to the legendary set (so you'll still have your original 'experimental' set at the end - along with your legendary armour).)

As for Minstrel trinkets, I just got them all via the Living World Season 3 maps with [Winterberries][item: winterberry] and the like, but of course you can use any stat-selectable ascended trinkets you have on hand.  
Other stat combinations' trinkets can be cheaply crafted or bought so aren't worth getting ascended versions for.
